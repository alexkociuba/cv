        <p><h3>Personal Profile</h3>
        <p>Originally from the UK and currently residing in the UAE. I started learning Python in 2021 and now seeking an entry-level Python-based role within Dubai.
        <p>My existing skill-set is drawn from a range of environments; from high-pressure trading desks (sports betting), high-volume logistics centres (home-shopping), and within the vocational education sector.
        Adept at gathering, analysing and assessing quantitative and qualitative client-based data for all manner of purposes, including loss-prevention (risk, fraud detection) and profit-maximisation (marketing, customer-retention, demographic profiling).  Capable of managing a team, spearheading projects, and conducting discreet investigations.
